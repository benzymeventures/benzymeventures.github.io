At Benzyme Ventures, we promote biotech innovation and education among Sri Lankan universities. That's why we've launched the University Ambassadors program. Our ambassadors connect Benzyme with university students, communicating and organizing events, workshops, and other opportunities for students to learn and grow in the biotech industry.

Whether you're a student looking to build your skills and network, or a researcher looking to share your expertise, our University Ambassadors will support you to be a part of our growing community.
